//MARK: - Simple Values

/// - Experiment: Create a constant with an explicit type of Float and a value of 4.

let four: Float = 4

///


/// - Experiment: Try removing the conversion to String from the last line. What error do you get?

let size = 40
let label = "The width is \(size)."
let sizeLabel = label + String(size)

//uncomment line below to see error
//let sizeLabel = label + size
